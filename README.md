# 👋 Hi, I'm Timothy!

I'm a passionate undergraduate student at James Madison University (graduating fall of 2026) studying and performing mathematical research in combinatorial geometry. My repositories range from research projects to HackerRank & Leetcode problems to lecture notes from classes I've taken to lecture notes for classes which I teach / TA! 

My main project at the moment is research within JMU's department of mathematics, via,
 - the Brakke-Mason Research Grant ($1900) to research the Bruhat Order on the set of fixed point free involutions with Dr. Rebecca Field.

My backup project at the moment is organizing two separate algebraic geometry seminars. One of them is a public seminar, and so I've been posting the lecture videos on a Youtube channel, linked below. We are following Chapter 1 of Hartshorne's 'Algebraic Geometry' into Chapters 1-12 of Vakil's 'The Rising Sea'. The other seminar is private, but we have been doing a preliminary series in Abstract Algebra following Artin's 'Algebra' book.

I also run the Madison Institute for Mathematical Finance (MIMF) at James Madison University which centers around teaching undergraduate students the mathematical tools needed to break into quantitative finance, then helping them produce quantitative research products in the form of:
 - Algorithmic Mean-Reversion Trading Strategies
 - Algorithmic Arbitrage Extraction
 - High-Frequency Trading Architecture.

My participation in MIMF falls into the following categories:
 - Managing the organizational structure
 - Approving and placing trades (daily) proposed by the quantitative trading team
 - Setting priorities and managing the expectations for the research teams
 - Lecturing nightly, typing lecture notes & homeworks, and grading work for the incoming class of Junior Scholars
 - Running the computational algebra research group, researching arbitrage extraction strategies and HFT architecture development.
